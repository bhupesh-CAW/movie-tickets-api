This is Movie ticket booking API created by Django Rest Framework. You can search the movie according to cinemas,city and ongoing shows. You can book any of  the shows. 

# üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Python >=3.8
Django >= 3.0 
Django-Rest-Framework = ANY
PipEnv - Environment setup
Pip
PostMan
```

Dependencies are

```
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'rest_auth',
    'rest_auth.registration',
```

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

First, you need to clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/jainbhupesh533/movie-tickets-api.git
```
then, after cloning you need to create virtual environment using pipenv 

```
pip install pipenv
```
Run the Shell
```
pipenv shell 
```
Now, Install all the dependencies

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```
* IF above one is not working,
  ```
   pipenv lock --requirements
  ```

After activating the shell, we now setup the django-server

Make proper Migrations on python code
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Now, its the final step to run our API
```
python manage.py runserver
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
